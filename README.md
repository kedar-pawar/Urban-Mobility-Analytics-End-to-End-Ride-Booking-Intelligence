🔹 Project Title

Urban Mobility Analytics – End-to-End Ride Booking Intelligence

🔹 Project Summary

Urban Mobility Analytics is an end-to-end data analytics project that analyzes ride-booking operations for an urban mobility platform. The project integrates Power BI, Python, SQL, and MySQL to perform data extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI calculation, and interactive dashboard reporting. The objective is to transform raw booking data into actionable business insights related to operations, revenue, cancellations, and customer & driver experience.

🔹 Problem Statement

Urban ride-booking platforms face challenges such as high cancellation rates, uneven fleet utilization, revenue leakage, and fluctuating customer satisfaction. This project addresses these challenges by answering:

What is the overall booking success and cancellation rate?

Which vehicle types perform best operationally and financially?

What factors contribute most to ride cancellations?

How do customer and driver ratings vary across vehicle categories?

🔹 Tech Stack & Tools

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

Python – Data analysis and EDA using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL (MySQL) – Data querying, aggregations, joins, and filtering

SQL with Python – SQL queries executed via Python for analysis and validation

CSV / Relational Dataset – Simulated urban mobility booking data

🔹 Analysis Workflow

Data Extraction & Querying

Queried booking data using MySQL to calculate aggregates and KPIs

Executed SQL queries within Python for validation and exploratory analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
