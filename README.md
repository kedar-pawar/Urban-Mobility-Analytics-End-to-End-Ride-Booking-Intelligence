# 🚕 Urban Mobility Analytics – End-to-End Ride Booking Intelligence (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end urban mobility analytics solution** built using **Power BI**, focused on analyzing ride-booking data to uncover demand patterns, operational efficiency, revenue drivers, cancellations, and customer & driver experience.

The dashboard simulates a real-world ride-hailing platform (similar to Ola/Uber) and demonstrates how data-driven insights support operational and business decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall booking performance and platform activity  
- Identify demand trends and revenue patterns  
- Understand cancellation behavior and operational loss  
- Evaluate fleet performance across vehicle types  
- Assess customer and driver experience using ratings

## 🗂 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains ride-booking records with the following attributes:
- Booking ID, Date, Time  
- Booking Status (Successful, Cancelled, Incomplete)  
- Vehicle Type  
- Ride Distance  
- Booking Value  
- Payment Method  
- Cancellation Reasons (Customer & Driver)  
- Customer Ratings & Driver Ratings
