> Urban Mobility Analytics–End-to-End Ride Booking Intelligence (Power
> BI)
>
> Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end urban mobility analytics solution
built using Power BI, focused on analysingride-booking data to uncover
demand patterns, operational efficiency, revenue drivers, cancellations,
andcustomer & driver experience.

The dashboard is designed to simulate a real-world ride-hailing platform
(similar to Ola/Uber) and demonstrates how data-driven insights can
support business and operational decisions.

> Objectives
>
> • Analyseoverall ride-booking performance anddemand trends
>
> • Identify revenue patterns and preferred payment methods
>
> • Understandcancellation behaviourandoperational losses
>
> • Evaluate fleet performance across vehicle types
>
> • Assess customer and driver experience usingratings

🗂Dataset Overview

> • The dataset includes the followingkey attributes:
>
> • Booking ID, Date, Time
>
> • Booking Status (Successful, Cancelled, Incomplete)
>
> • Vehicle Type
>
> • Ride Distance
>
> • Booking Value
>
> • Payment Method
>
> • Cancellation Reasons (Customer & Driver)
>
> • Customer Ratings & Driver Ratings
>
> Dashboard Structure
>
> Overall Performance Overview
>
> • Total Bookings
>
> • Booking Status Distribution
>
> • Ride Volume Over Time
>
> • Platform activitytimeline

Key Insight:

> • Stable daily demand isobserved, but only 67.48% of bookings are
> successfully completed, highlighting a significantopportunity to
> reduce cancellations and incomplete rides.
>
> Fleet & Vehicle Performance
>
> • Total and successful bookings by vehicle type
>
> • Average ride distance
>
> • Fleet utilization comparison

Purpose:

> • Identify high-performing vehicle categories and optimize fleet
> allocation.
>
> Revenue & Demand Insights
>
> • Ride distance distribution over time
>
> • Revenue by payment method
>
> • Top customers by booking value

Purpose:

> • Understand revenue concentration, customervalue, and payment
> preferences.
>
> Cancellations & Loss Analysis
>
> • Customer vs Driver cancellation breakdown
>
> • Cancellation reasons analysis
>
> • Total cancelled bookings and cancellation rate

Purpose:

> • Identify operational inefficiencies and major contributors to demand
> loss.
>
> Customer & DriverExperience
>
> • Average, maximum, and minimumratings
>
> • Vehicle-wise comparison of customer and driver satisfaction

Purpose:

> • Evaluate service quality consistency across vehicle categories.
>
> Key Metrics (DAX Highlights)
>
> • Total Bookings
>
> • Successful Bookings
>
> • Cancelled Bookings
>
> • Cancellation Rate (%)
>
> • Average Ride Distance
>
> • Revenue by Payment Method

All KPIs are validated toensure:

> • Total Bookings = Successful + Cancelled
